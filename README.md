# eCommerce data analysis and visualization with MS Excel

## Overview
This project focuses on data analysis and visualization using **Microsoft Excel**. The dataset is centered around an **eCommerce platform**, containing sales data across multiple channels, products, and customer demographics. The analysis dives into the sales performance in various cities and states, categorized by age group and gender.

The project demonstrates how to utilize Excel's built-in tools like PivotTables, charts, and conditional formatting to extract valuable insights and create interactive dashboards.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following key attributes:
- **Product Information**: Product category, product name, and SKU.
- **Sales Data**: Sales volume, revenue, and discounts applied.
- **Customer Demographics**: Age group and gender of customers.
- **Geographical Data**: Information about cities and states.
- **Sales Channel**: Different channels like online, in-store, and others.

### Dataset Columns:

## Excel Visualizations
The following types of visualizations were created in Microsoft Excel:
1. **Sales Performance by Product**: PivotTables and bar charts showing total sales (both units sold and revenue) by product.
2. **Sales by Channel**: Pie charts to display the proportion of sales by different channels (e.g., online vs. in-store).
3. **Demographic Breakdown**: A dashboard with slicers to filter sales data by age group and gender.
4. **Geographical Distribution**: Maps and charts to visualize sales performance across different cities and states.
5. **Trends Over Time**: Line graphs to analyze sales trends based on product, age group, or sales channel.

## Features
- **PivotTables**: Summarize large datasets, allowing users to view sales by different dimensions (product, age, gender, etc.).
- **Charts**: Various chart types such as bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs for data visualization.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Highlight key insights such as high-performing products or regions with low sales.
- **Slicers**: Interactive filters that allow for dynamic and customized views of the data (by product, age, gender, etc.).
- **Geo Mapping**: Maps and charts to explore sales by geographic region.
